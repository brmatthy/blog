# Winterstorm - Music Video
> September 16, 2020

Winterstorm is the first single & music video we released with Worlds Beyond to promote our debut album. To make it accessible, we chose one of our most mainstream singles for this job: an up-tempo heavy symphonic metal track with lots of high classical vocals.

The music video is a classic band video, showcasing us playing the song at an industrial filming location. We wanted to get the basics right before doing anything more fancy in later videos. Still, it was a long night playing this song over and over again to get the required camera coverage. This project was done almost completely DIY, with our friend Brecht Dhuyvetters helping out with filming & editing.
